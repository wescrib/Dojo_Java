V1:
this version contains a basic registration for new users (first + last name, email, and password)
the users accounts do not have much content yet
administrator accounts have also been implimented and can change nearly every property of standard user accounts, except for password changes.
administrator accounts can also make new users (standard or more administrators) from their own accounts.
administrators can also delete other accounts, including other administrators. we should probably put contraints on this in the future.
